        <h1>Your Guide to Optimizing Images for SEO</h1>
        <p>Images are a vital part of creating quality, engaging content online. People
          have short attention spans and no one wants to open a page only to find an
          unbroken wall of text staring back at them. Photos, infographics, illustrations
          and other images are a key way to supplement your text to make your page look
          attractive and consumable. In fact, here at WooRank, we have a two image minimum
          policy for our blog (for posts about things other than company and product news).
          And, as an added bonus, images have the potential to bring in more traffic through
          image search results.</p>

        <p>However, to make this happen you need to optimize your images for search
          engines as well as human users. Lucky for you, we’ve created this guide to using
          images in a way that will complement the rest of your on page SEO. Making your
          pages engaging and easy to read is a major part of user experience, which can have a
          noticeable impact on your SEO; bad UX leads to high bounce rates, which is a
          ranking signal used by search engines. So choosing the right image for your page
          can be almost as important as how you optimize it for SEO.</p>
        <p>It’s also important for you to place images on your page that are relevant to
          the text around it. Along with file name, alt attributes and image titles (which
          we’ll cover a little bit later), search engines use the page content surrounding
          images to determine what the image is showing. It’s an important signal used to
          determine relevance to a keyword used when searching Google or Bing image search.</p>
        <h3>Free Images</h3>
        <p>Use your own images whenever possible. This will help you use images that are
          the most relevant to your content, and it will also help you avoid the
          potentially thorny issue of copyright. However, if you can’t reliably create
          your own quality images, there are some tools and services out there that will
          help you find images:</p>
        <p>After you’ve found, or created, the right image, optimization begins with choosing
          the right filename. They provide a benefit to your page’s SEO, and are critical for
          ranking in image search results. Just like when you’re creating a URL, use your
          target keyword and use it at the beginning. Never use the default image file name,
          like “DSC00087.jpg” unless it’s absolutely unavoidable. Many content management
          systems use the file name to create the image title, so this will pay off for you
          even more later.</p>
