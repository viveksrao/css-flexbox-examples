    <h1>Creating Responsive Forms with Flexbox</h1>
    <p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/" title="Flexbox">Flexible Layout Box Model</a>, better known as
    <strong>Flexbox</strong>, is a great tool for crafting responsive regions or UI elements.
    While not well-suited for complete page layouts, Flexbox excels at controlling elements along
    a single axis or in arranging elements within discreet regions. This makes Flexbox a fantastic tool
    for creating responsive page elements that are normally tricky to handle, such as forms.
    Often Flexbox can create responsive components with a minimal amount of code and little to no media queries.</p>
    <h2>Short Forms</h2>
    <p>Our first exercise will focus on the basic concepts of how Flexbox can help create responsive
    content. We'll start with a basic search form that consists of two elements, a search input and a submit button.</p>
